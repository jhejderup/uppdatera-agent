## Building [Control Flow Analysis](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/flow.html)

Recursively applying these rules allows to determine the execution status of all instructions of a method â€“ given that we have probes at the right positions. Therefore JaCoCo inserts probes

- at every method exit (return or throws) and
- at every edge where the target instruction is the target of more than one edge.
